# WebSockets

WebSockets are a protocol that enables full-duplex, bidirectional communication between a client (typically a web browser) and a server over a single TCP connection.

## Key Features

- Real-time, event-driven communication
- Persistent connection
- Low latency
- Supports both text and binary data

## How It Works

1. Client initiates a WebSocket connection through a process called the WebSocket handshake
2. If the server supports the WebSocket protocol, the connection is established
3. Both client and server can send messages to each other at any time
4. The connection remains open until either party closes it

## Common Use Cases

- Real-time applications
- Live chat systems
- Gaming
- Financial trading platforms
- Collaborative editing tools
- Live sports updates
- IoT device communication

## Advantages Over HTTP

- Reduced latency
- Lower overhead
- Real-time data transfer
- Server push capability

## Implementation

WebSockets can be implemented using various programming languages and frameworks. Popular choices include:

- JavaScript (browser-side)
- Node.js with libraries like Socket.IO or ws
- Python with libraries like websockets or Flask-SocketIO
- Java with libraries like Java-WebSocket or Spring WebSocket

## Security Considerations

- Use secure WebSocket connections (WSS) over TLS
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate and sanitize incoming messages
- Protect against denial-of-service attacks
